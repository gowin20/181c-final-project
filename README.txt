Repository containing all files for the GEOG 181C Final Project: Student Activity Locator

The authors of this project were Peter Flanders, George Owen, Wesley Motlow, Grant Linford, and Seamus Sehres.

Getting Started:
1. First, clone/download this repository.
2. The required packages are 
  - The Python Standard Library
  - arcpy 
3. Optional Packages include:
  - geopy (this is a more consistent geocoding service, but a pain to install with ArcGIS Pro's conda envs)
3. If you want to use the --address argument to specify the location of the mapbook, you need to either have installed geopy or you need to add a file called `config.json` in the root directory with your ArcGIS Developer API Key.  
4. You can run the main script with `python activities-mapbook-181c.py`
4. This should produce logs in the terminal indicating progress and after ~10min the final mapbook pdf should be created and saved in the output folder.

Optional arguments for the script are as follows:
  -h, the help flag which explains these arguments to users in the command line.
  --lat, which takes in a single float value, the latitude (must be used with --long)
  --long, which takes in a single float value, the longitutde (must be used with --lat)
  --address, which takes a string and attempts to geocode it based on some conditions, 
  -t, which is a boolean flag which allows the user to run the script as a test. MUCH QUICKER

Sample usage:
`
python .\activities-mapbook-181c.py --address "337 Charles E Young Dr E, Los Angeles, CA 90095"
`
This line of code runs a full book of routes from the address of UCLA's Public Affairs Building at the address listed above.
