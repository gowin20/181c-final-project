Repository containing all files for the GEOG 181C Final Project: Student Activity Locator

The authors of this project were Peter Flanders, George Owen, Wesley Motlow, Grant Linford, and Seamus Sehres.

How to run:
1. First, clone this repository.
2. The required packages are 
  - The Python Standard Library
  - arcpy (recommended to use the default ArcGIS Pro Python environment `arcgispro-py3`)
3. Once your environment is set up, you can run the main script with `python activities-mapbook-181c.py`
4. This should produce logs in the terminal indicating progress and after ~10min the final mapbook pdf should be created and saved in the output folder.
